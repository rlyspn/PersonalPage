My name is Riley Spahn.
I am a computer science Ph.D. student at Columbia University working under [Dr. Roxana Geambasu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~roxana/) and [Dr. Gail Kaiser](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser/).
I am broadly interested computer systems with a focus on security, privacy, and data management.

## Experience
### Google, Mountain View, CA (May 2014-Present)
I am a software engineering intern working on the Android platform security team.

### Columbia University, New York, NY (January 2013-Present)
I am conducting research related to fine grained data management on mobile devices.

### Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN (June-August 2011, May-December 2012)
I worked in the Cyberspace Science and Information Intelligence Research Group (CSIIR) and built distributed systems applications for data analytics using the Storm framework and NodeJS.
I also worked on a system call based anomaly detection system.

### Auburn University, Auburn, AL (February-May 2011, August 2011-May 2012)
At Auburn I worked under Dr. Xiao Qin and Dr. Orlando Acevedo.
Under Dr. Acevedo I built a framework for molecular dynamics simulation framework parallelized using NVIDIA's CUDA architecture.
In Dr. Qin's lab I worked on a distributed cryptosystem built on top of Apache Hadoop.
I also wrote projects for a future Hadoop based distributed systems class.
